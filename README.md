# Text Normalization for Low Resource Languages

This repository contains code and data related to the Google open source internship project Text Normalization for Low Resource Languages.

## Project Description

With approximately 7,000 languages in the world, especially with lower resource languages, the trade-offs in terms of rejecting training data vs. cleaning it up (or using less clean training data) are different.  We would like to find out what kind of data typically gets lost during normalization, and if there are any repeating patterns within language families or scripts that can better inform normalization decisions.  The intern will be free to formulate their own approach to these questions and to formulate and pursue other linguistic questions to text normalization and corpus linguistics.  The intern will download some public data sets and will experiment with different linguistic choices for normalization, some of which can come from previous Google papers in this space, and others will be up to the internâ€™s creativity.  The intern will then train some LMs and other NLP models using open-source libraries with various normalization configs, and will measure the quality of these models, and write up an analysis of what normalization method is best.

#TODO(azupon): Update README.md as the project progresses with information about code, and usage.
